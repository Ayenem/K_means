## Requirements
- **C++2a**
- **gcc 10**
    - `msvc` hasn't implemented `std::ranges` yet and `clang`'s `std::ranges`/`concepts` seem to be yet incomplete.
- The only external dependency is `fmtlib` for output display but it isn't strictly necessary.

## Demo
See https://godbolt.org/z/9TcGj7

```cpp
using std::array, kmn::DataPoint;
using kmn::print_clusters, kmn::k_means;
auto const df = array{DataPoint(1, 2, 3),
                      DataPoint(4, 5, 6),
                      DataPoint(7, 8, 9),
                      DataPoint(10, 11, 12),
                      DataPoint(13, 14, 15),
                      DataPoint(16, 17, 18),
                      DataPoint(19, 20, 21),
                      DataPoint(22, 23, 24),
                      DataPoint(25, 26, 27),
                      DataPoint(28, 29, 30),
                      DataPoint(31, 32, 33),
                      DataPoint(34, 35, 36),
                      DataPoint(37, 38, 39),
                      DataPoint(40, 41, 42)};

print("OUTPUT clusters:\n\n");
print_clusters(k_means<4>(df, 100));
```
```
OUTPUT clusters:

centroid: {7, 8, 9}
satellites: {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {10, 11, 12}}

centroid: {16, 17, 18}
satellites: {{13, 14, 15}, {19, 20, 21}, {22, 23, 24}}

centroid: {28, 29, 30}
satellites: {{25, 26, 27}, {31, 32, 33}}

centroid: {37, 38, 39}
satellites: {{34, 35, 36}, {40, 41, 42}}
```
A call to `kmn::k_means<K>(data_frame, n)` returns a range of `K` clusters formed through `n` update iterations (the higher the `n` the better the partitioning).

A data point is to be wrapped with the `kmn::DataPoint<T, D>` type, with `T` an arithmetic type and `D` the point's dimensionality. `T` and `D` can be implicit through CTAD as shown in the above example. All data points must naturally have the same dimensionality.

A `std::array<kmn::DataPoint<T, D>, SZ>` is currently the type expected of the input data range.

## Thanks
My thanks go to a few competent minds from the #includecpp Discord who helped me in understanding the C++ ins and outs to write this code: sarah, LÃ©o, marcorubini, oktal and Lesley Lai.
